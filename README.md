# 🎧 Sonic Currency – NFT Valuation Engine for Spotify Songs

What if Spotify songs were sold as NFTs?

**Sonic Currency** is a data analytics project that uses Spotify audio features to score songs across three dimensions:
- 🧠 MoodScore: Emotional positivity and energy
- 🔁 ReplayScore: Likelihood of repeat listening
- 🧬 UniquenessScore: Deviation from the average song

These scores are combined into a **NFT_Valuation** metric that ranks each track and classifies it into NFT tiers:  
**Common, Rare, Legendary**.

## 📊 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas for data prep & scoring)
- Power BI (dashboard design & visuals)
- DAX (tier logic, interactivity)
- Spotify 160k+ song dataset

## 🧠 Dashboard Features
- Top 10 songs by NFT_Valuation
- Distribution of valuation tiers
- Mood vs ReplayScore scatter analysis
- Trait Breakdown (“Sonic Signature” per song)
- NFT Marketplace Table with filters & slicers
